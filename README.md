# AutoSqli
AutoSQLi Detector is an advanced, fully automated error-based SQL injection scanner built as a Burp Suite extension. It passively scans **all proxy traffic**, fuzzes parameters using multiple payloads, analyzes responses for DB-specific errors, detects WAF blocks, and flags high-confidence SQL injection indicators.
